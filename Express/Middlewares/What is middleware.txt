Middleware allows us to edit the incomming request before it gets processed and reach their final destination: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE. 

Middleware types:
Preprocessing: edit request.
Logging: log request data, state, status, etc.
Authentication: validating request origin.
Error Handling: handling any errors in the request.
